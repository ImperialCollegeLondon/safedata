\title{Obtaining locations for a SAFE dataset.}
\usage{
get_locations(obj, gazetteer_info = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A single record id, or an existing safedata dataframe.}

\item{gazetteer_info}{Should all the gazetteer fields be included in the
returned \code{\link[sf]{sf}} object.}
}
\value{
An object of classes "safe_locations", "sf" and "data.frame".
}
\description{
This function returns a spatial 'simple features' (\code{\link[sf]{sf}})
object for a dataset record, including basic information about locations
for the SAFE gazetteer if requested.
}
\details{
All SAFE datasets recording observations from the field must include a
Locations worksheet, which must contain all of the location names used
in Locations type fields in data worksheets. These entries are matched
against existing location names in the SAFE gazetteer. Users can
also include "new" location names in their dataset, which do not
necessarily have coordinates. Processing locations works as
follows:
\enumerate{
    \item Known locations (\code{new_location = FALSE}) are matched
          against both the official location names in the gazetteer
          and the accepted aliases.
    \item New locations are first checked against the location aliases
          list to see if any new locations in this dataset have been
          matched to a gazetteer location. The gazetteer location is
          then used in preference to any new location data within the
          dataset.
    \item Finally, remaining new locations are assigned any feature
          geometry within the dataset. New locations do not necessarily
          have geometry data, so may have null or empty geometries.
}
}
\note{
Not all SAFE project datasets contain locations. In this case
  \code{\link{get_locations}} will return NULL.
