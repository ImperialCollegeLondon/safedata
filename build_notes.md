# Building and releasing safedata

This repository and package uses a number of systems that you need to be aware
of if you plan to work with the codebase:

* Documentation for the package is maintained using `roxygen` and `pkgdown`.
* The code should be checked using linting for consistent style.
* The repository has (now) been set up to use the git flow system for
  controlling development and releases across branches.
* The repository uses the Travis continuous integration (CI) system. 

These notes provide a brief walk through for these systems and some package
specific requirements for releases. 

#### Build scripts

The `build_scripts` folder in the repository contains scripts containing the
code blocks used in some of the steps described below. All are set up to be run
from directly inside the `build_scripts` directory. Scripts are described in
context below

### Package documentation

With the `roxygen` package , all of the package documentation is located in one
of three places:

1. Markup inside the `R` source files - there are blocks of comments starting
   with `#'` that contain all of the documentation that goes into the normal R
   documentaion (`.Rd`) files. 
2. Vignettes, formatted as `Rmarkdown` files in the `vignettes` directory.

When the documentation has been changed then the `.Rd` files in `man` and any
vignettes in `doc` can be built automatically. The key command is:

```sh
Rscript -e "devtools::document()"
```

These documentation pages are a key part of the package and so whenever the code
changes, the documentation should be rebuilt  before commits are made: this
ensures that the full package is submitted to Travis CI.

### Website

In addition to using `roxygen` to maintain the in-package documentation,
`safedata` also uses `pkgdown` to create a documentation website. The
configuration for this is in the `_pkgdown.yml` file. This file typically only
needs updating when new functions are added, as they need to be added into the
reference structure. The website will contain an HTML version of the Rd files
and vignettes but also extra content: for example `README.md` is used to create
`index.html` and other markdown files can be used to provide other content.

Rebuilding the website uses two commands:

```sh
Rscript -e " pkgdown::clean_site()"
Rscript -e " pkgdown::build_site()"
```

This removes old files and recreates the website in the `docs` directory (_not_
`doc`!). This directory is then automatically used by GitHub Pages to create the
package website at:

https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/safedata/

The website files themselves are _not_ part of the continuous integration of the
package and having to build and then commit changes within `docs` is untidy. The
`safedata` package therefore includes `docs` in the `.gitignore` file: you can
have a local copy of the website but it is not managed by git.

Instead, the package is set up using a recipe described here:

https://www.r-bloggers.com/continuous-deployment-of-package-documentation-with-pkgdown-and-travis-ci/

The basic idea of this plan is that Travis CI is configured to run `pkgdown` and
build the `docs` when a build on the `master` branch succeeds. Those files are
then deployed from Travis to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository and used in
the website. This means that the website only ever refreshes when a release is
created and not when any changes are made to the repo. 

For local use, the package and website build steps have been bundled together
in `build_scripts/build_docs.sh`. However, note that there are two different
things go

### Linting

The linting process inspects the R code files in the package to check they have
a consistent coding and syntax style. The file `build_scripts/collect_lint.sh`
runs the code linting and updates the file `lint.txt` in the package root.

The `.lintr` file in the package root is used to configure the linting and set
any exclusions. This is currently done on a line by line basis to note specific
exceptions. It is also possible to exclude code from linting using `# nolint`
tags in the source code, but I'm avoiding this to keep the code files relatively
clean. It does mean that `.lintr` has to be updated if the line numbers of
exceptions change.

```sh
cd build_scripts
./collect_lint.sh
```

### Repository structure

The package uses the Gitflow branching model for the package repository  and the
`git-flow` extensions to help manage this (https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).

Day to day development happens on the `develop` branch, although you can also
create specific `feature` branches for new features.  When you have code that
you want to release as a new version then `git flow` is used to create a
`release` branch that is used to check and make final changes. That `release`
branch is then merged into `master` and tagged as the new release, and also back
into `develop` to bring back last minute fixes. The `master` branch should
really only ever see merges in from a `release` branch - you should not work on
it directly.

The package uses semantic version numbering (https://semver.org/) and code on
the development branch should use the prerelease token `9000`. This is explained
in more detail below in the description of the release cycle.

### Travis CI

When commits are pushed to the Github origin then the package is automatically
built and checked by Travis:

https://travis-ci.org/github/ImperialCollegeLondon/safedata

This happens on all branches, so day to day commits to `develop` will be built
as well as commits to `release` branches and the creation of new tagged versions
on `master`.

If you have made changes that you do not want to be built and checked then you
can include `[ci skip]`, but the idea is that all changes should be checked so
this is typically only used for documentation changes and the like.

## Release cycle

These are the steps needed to release a new version of `safedata`.

### Configure `git`

It is easier if `git` is configured to push new tags along with commits. This
essentially just means that new releases can be sent with a single commit, which
is simpler and saves Travis from building both the the code commit and then the
tagged version. This only needs to be set once.

```sh
set git config --global push.followTags true
```

### Update the example directory

The `safedata` package ships with a zipped `safedata` directory that is used in
the code examples. The search functionality in `safedata` uses the live database
via the API so, unless you update this example directory, running the search
examples may return Zenodo record IDs that are missing from the example
directory. This will create checking errors.

The file `build_scripts/refresh_example_dir.R` contains the code needed to the
example directory with a freshly zipped copy with up to date indices. Of course,
if someone publishes a new dataset before the release occurs, you may still get
an error and have to repeat this step!

```sh
cd build_scripts
Rscript refresh_example_dir.R
```

### Update the vignette objects

The `safedata` package ships with a file `R/sysdata.rda` that contains all of
the data displayed in the vignettes. This is so that the vignette code does not
_require_ an internet connection for the code to be run, which is safer for
CRAN. By default, these files are used in the vignette build and the file is
created using:

```sh
cd build_scripts
Rscript vignette_objects.R
```

### Check the code.

Releases start from the `develop` branch, with a bunch of commits that you want
to release as a new version. Before you do anything, you should check that the
current commit in `develop` is building correctly. 

There are three steps. First, the package contains a test suite, which currently 
only checks that network failures are handled gracefully. Those have to be passing
before the package can be built so:

```sh
Rscript -e "devtools::test()
```

If the tests pass, then the second step is to build and install the package with
minimal checking to see that this works and to make sure all of the most recent
updates are available in installed files

```sh
 R CMD BUILD safedata --no-build-vignettes
 R CMD BUILD safedata_xxxxxxxx.tar.gz
```

With these files all in place, you can now verify that the complete code
packaging, documentation building and formal CRAN checking passes.

```sh
cd build_scripts
./build_and_check.sh
```

Because nearly all of the actual user changes happen in the vignette and R
files, it is easy to forget to update the documentation, so a full checking
process starts there. The code below runs the full checking process on your
local machine. The code in `build_and_check.sh`  is reproduced here to show
the steps.

```sh
# a) Move into the source directory and update the documents
#    using Roxygen and pkgdown
cd safedata
Rscript -e "devtools::document()"
Rscript -e " pkgdown::clean_site()"
Rscript -e " pkgdown::build_site()"
cd ../

# b) Build the package from the source directory
R CMD BUILD safedata

# c) Identify the version name that just got built from the 
#    package DESCRIPTION file and then check it for CRAN
VERSION=$(sed -n -e '4p' safedata/DESCRIPTION  | cut -d " "  -f 2)
R CMD CHECK --as-cran --run-donttest safedata_$VERSION.tar.gz 
```

Two points to note:

1. The built package and check output are saved in the parent directory of the
   repository, not in the repository itself.
2. The version built is the one in the _currently checked out branch_. 

The key file to look at is `safedata.Rcheck/00check.log`. This contains a long
list of checks applied to the code. Look out for `NOTE`, `WARNING` and `ERROR`
and resolve these issues before moving on. If you are checking in the `develop`
branch then you will see a note saying `Version contains large components` -
that is about to be fixed.

#### Vignette building

By default, the vignettes should build without using the network to download
resources. This can be verified by setting an environment variable and running
from the package root:

```sh
export URL_DOWN=TRUE
Rscript -e "pkgdown::build_articles()"
```

However, the articles can also be built using the network by setting the
following:

 ```sh
export BUILD_VIGNETTE_USING_REMOTE=TRUE
Rscript -e "pkgdown::build_articles()"
```

This is marginally better, because it is automatically up to date and contains
more of the expected messages, which haven't been fully duplicated in the
offline mode.

### Create the new release branch

If all is ok then the code is in theory ready to release. The following creates
a new candidate branch containing the current `develop` code. You need to
specify the upcoming release version number, so for example to release version
`1.0.6`:

```sh
git flow release start 1.0.6
```

This will create the `release/1.0.6` branch and check it out.

You should now immediately update the `DESCRIPTION` file to match that version
number. In this example, that should mean changing the previous development
version number (`-9000` is used to indicate code in development between versions
):

```
Version: 1.0.5-9000
```

to 

```
Version: 1.0.6
```

You can then commit that change:

```sh
git commit -m "Update version number" DESCRIPTION
```

At the moment, the `release` branch is only local. The release branch and code
needs to be pushed to Github to be picked up by Travis CI. There is a specific
`git flow` command to do this:

```
git flow release publish 1.0.6
```

This sends the release branch up to be checked. In addition, there is now a
release branch on origin so any other last minutes fixes and commits can be
pushed in order to check those.

### Checking on different platforms.

The Travis CI build process should now be underway for the `release` branch.
Travis is configured (see `.travis.yml`) to build the package under R stable on
Ubuntu and Mac and R devel on Ubuntu. 

However, Travis CI does not currently check packages under Windows. Instead,
the R Project maintains a Windows test environment that can be used. This needs
a built copy of the `release` branch, so run `build_scripts/build_and_check.sh`
again. This should create a newly built package with the new version number
(e.g. `safedata_1.0.6.tar.gz`). If everything checked out ok before creating the
release, this is really just updating the version name. 

You then need to upload that file to `win-builder`. The python script
`build_scripts/upload_to_win-builder.py`  will do this for you - it is simply
automating the process of using FTP to upload the current version for checking
under both R stable and R devel. Note that `win-builder` communicates by email
with the package maintainer (whoever has the `cre` flag in the `authors` section
of the `DESCRIPTION` file.

```sh
python build_scripts/upload_to_win-builder.py
```

### Wait.

Ideally what happens now is that the build and check process on Travis CI and
`win-builder` all pass. You **must** wait for these checks to complete!

Obviously, if any errors or warnings crop up in the checking process, those
should be fixed in the `release` branch. The changes should be committed and
pushed to start a new round of Travis CI checking and you will need to rebuild
and resubmit to `win-builder`

### Final edits

There are some final edits to check you have made:

- Update `NEWS` to document the changes since the previous version
- Update `cran-comments.md` to record the R versions and environments used for
  testing and the outcomes of those builds. This should all be `status: OK` but
  there might be notes that should be explained.

You now should also build the final version of the release code to be submitted
to CRAN:

```sh
cd build_scripts
./build_and_check.sh
```

That should create the source package in the parent directory (e.g.
`safedata-1.0.6.tar.gz`).

These edits and building will obviously also need to be committed and so there
is likely to be one last round of CI runs, but this will just be documentation
and information changes and so is unlikely to reveal new issues. Of course, if
it does, you'll have to fix them!

### Finish the release

Once the `release` branch is passing checks on all platforms, then the candidate
release is ready to be released as a version.  Again using `1.0.6` as the
example version number, the command is:

```sh
git flow release finish 1.0.6
```

You will be asked for some commit messages and a new tag comment, which will
simply be the version number. You should then be on the `develop` branch. You
now need to checkout the `master` branch which should now have all the commits
since the last release and a new tag with the version number. You can now push
this to create the release - if you've set the config described above then a
single push will create the commit and tag.

```sh
git checkout master
git push
```

This will set off another round of Travis CI checking - you should see the
tagged version being built and checked. This should all go cleanly! 

You should now **immediately** get off the `master` branch and back onto
`develop`, before you accidentally change the files or commit to it, You should
also **immediately** update the version number in `DESCRIPTION`, adding `-9000`
to show that this is now the development version from the new release. This is a
trivial change, so we can use `[ci skip]` to avoid triggering a Travis build.

```sh
git checkout develop
# Edit DESCRIPTION to e.g. version 1.0.6-9000
git commit -m "Bump develop version [ci skip]" DESCRIPTION
git push
```


### Release to CRAN

You can then submit the built version of the source package that was created
during the release process at: https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html

You  should  take the up-to-date contents of `cran-comments.md` and  copy that
in the comments section of the submission form. The CRAN maintainers expect
submitted packages to be functional and fully checked and these notes will help
them see that the package has been properly checked.
