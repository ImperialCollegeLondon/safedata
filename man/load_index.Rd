\title{Load and cache the dataset index}
\usage{
load_index()
}
\value{
Returns NULL invisibly - use get_index() to obtain the
   index data.
}
\description{
This function loads the dataset record index from the JSON file in
the SAFE data directory and sets which datasets are currently available
and which records are the most recent available under a given concept.
The function also checks to see if there are any user modifications to
the directory structure.
}
\details{
When any of the three index files (\code{index.json},
\code{gazetteer.geojson} and \code{location_aliases.csv}) are loaded,
the file contents are cached in memory to reduce load times. The cache
is within an environment that is not exported in the package namespace
and is not intended to be user accessible.
