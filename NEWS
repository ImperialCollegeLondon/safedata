2.0.0
    - Update to handle new API and NCBI taxa from safedata_server and 
      safedata_validator 3.0.0
    - Replaced all API and URL calls in examples, vignettes and testing with mocked
      content via a new api_mockr interface.

1.1.3
    - Bugfix in try_to_download: need to properly test GET requests, not just try HEAD,
      otherwise web failures (like httpbin timeouts) are not handled gracefully.
      Complete revamp of try_to_download.

1.1.2
    - Bugfix in test suite: test "Download dataset fails gracefully on Zenodo down"
      was not correctly checking for real metadata server failure before simulating 
      Zenodo access failure.
    - Updated gh-pages build system for GitHub Actions.

1.1.1
    - Updates of unit testing to gracefully handle _real_ internet failures as
      well as the failures explicitly simulated in the tests.

1.1.0
    - Updated functionality and examples to fail gracefully for network issues.
    - Fixed issue with data columns
    - Moved from Travis to Github Actions for CI.
    - Added testthat suite - currently just for graceful failure modes.

1.0.9
    - Further fixing of indexing functions to separate load_index from get_index
      to get clearer separation of setting safe dir and just wanting the indexing
      contents.
    - Fixed download_safe_files so that it updates the cached index to record the
      new local file copies.

1.0.8
    - Reorganised set_safe_dir and load_index to fix bug with new directories and 
      give cleaner code flow and organisation.
    - Added logical operators & and | for combining searches

1.0.7
    - Moved download_safe_files to use the website download URLs not API
    - Added ability to use tokens for restricted datasets (pretty rare, 
      but requires website URLS)
    - Fixed checking for field names to handle what early versions of safedata_validator missed
